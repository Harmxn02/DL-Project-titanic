# DL Project: Deep Learning - Titanic

## Assignment context

For this project we were tasked with completing a Kaggle competition. I chose the most popular competition namely ["Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## Content of this repository

In this repository you will find all of the `.ipynb` notebooks and datasets for a project I had for the course **Neural Networks & Deep Learning**.

## Folder structure

### Datasets

`/data/` contains all datasets

1. `gender_submission.csv` is a sample submission provided by the hosts of the competition
2. `train.csv` contains the dataset on which we need to train the model
3. `test.csv` contains the dataset on which we need to make predictions in the end

### Files

1. `main.ipynb` contains all models that were trained
2. `presentation.ipynb` contains all visualizations I used during the presentation
3. `mypy.ini` is a configuration file for MyPy

### Util

`/util/` contains utility modules

- `feature_engineer.py`, which is a module used to feature engineer both the training and test datasets.

### Public leaderboard

`/titanic-public-leaderboard/` contains all files that were used to create some visualizations used during the presentation

1. `leaderboard.ipynb` is the notebook with the code
2. `titanic-publicleaderboard-2024-04-17T17_58_43.csv` is the dataset I exported from Kaggle
